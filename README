Implementation of the web app learning tool 'Rotten Potatoes' from the UC Berkeley EdX CS169.1x and CS169.2x course book, "Engineering Software as a Service" by Armando Fox and David Patterson

The code within this repository is growing as I move through the textbook. I'm aiming to implement as much of the Rotten Potatoes web app functionality as shown, including many of the suggested projects.
